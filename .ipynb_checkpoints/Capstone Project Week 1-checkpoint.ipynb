The city holds around 13,960,236 people across 23 special wards [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo). Such a high amount of people aggregated in one city causes its density to reach around 6,363 people per square kilometer [[2]](https://www.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/tosei/hodohappyo/press/2021/01/28/01.html).\n",

On one hand, successful businesses can thrive at a faster pace and expand, however, this also means that businesses have added pressure to keep up with world trends and to cater to new customer needs in order to out-compete their massive competition. Furthermore, new businesses have an even harder time to enter this already established ecosystem.\n",

Restaurants, as an example, could wand to focus on workers that go around to find a meal during lunch time, areas with the highest number of companies/number of employees ratio could be attractive in this situation.

This analysis is not by far exhaustive, but hopefully can shed some insight on potential factors that could help in the decision or evaluation making process."
