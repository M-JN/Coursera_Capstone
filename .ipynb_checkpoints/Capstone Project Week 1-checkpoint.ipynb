    "Tokyo, or officially known as Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and the most populated prefecture in the entire country. The city holds around 13,960,236 people across 23 special wards [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo). Such a high amount of people aggregated in one city causes its density to reach around 6,363 people per square kilometer [[2]](https://www.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/tosei/hodohappyo/press/2021/01/28/01.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Densely populated areas tend to lead to a highly diversified market demand for food and other catering services. This can easily turn into a double edge sword. On one hand, successful businesses can thrive at a faster pace and expand, however, this also means that businesses have added pressure to keep up with world trends and to cater to new customer needs in order to out-compete their massive competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Location, location, location.* **Where should one start?** \n",
    "* From a shop owner perspective, a place that is located in a highly dense area, with \"hopefully\" lower land costs and even more \"hopefully\" less direct competition would be a good start. \n",
    "* From an investor perspective, the same information could be quite insightful to understand a business potential longevity and challenges (competition wise) in the short to mid-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims at providing a solution that relies heavily on the \"easy visualization\" data staple. So that both new shop owners and investors can quickly gather insight on viable new opportunities."
